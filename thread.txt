Threads: An entity within a process that can be scheduled (also known as "lightweight process")
A process can spawn multiple threads

+ All threads within a process share the same memory
+ Lightweight
+ Starting a thread is faster than starting a process
+ Great for I/O-bound tasks / An example would be when the program would be communicating with slower devices like a hard
drive or a network connection, while it is waiting it can switch to a different thread to start processing.

- Threading is limited by GIL: Only one thread at a time
- No effect for CPU-bound tasks
- Not interruptable/killable, thus must be careful of memory leaks
- Careful with race conditions, which is when two or more threads attempt to modify the same variable at the same time
